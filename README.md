Introduction
	The purpose for this project is to use machine learning to try to predict what language a certain text is written in. Let’s say you have encountered an unknown language while browsing the internet and you want to determine with certainty what language that is. This project uses python (a general-purpose programming language) along with multiple machine learning algorithms to do exactly that. 
Implementation
	The language identifier program (linked at the end of this document) uses multiple tools to analyze and process language information from 22 different languages used around the world. The machine learning algorithms being used to predict the language of a given text are:
•	Naïve Bayes - Supervised machine learning algorithm, which is used for classification tasks, like text classification.
•	K Nearest Neighbor - Non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.
•	Sum of Squared Differences - Statistical measure of deviation from the mean.
Using these 3 algorithms we can get an accurate comparison for how successful these methods are at determining the correct language for the entered text. 
Results
	This program provides conclusive information that all the 3 methods mentioned above deliver high predicting accuracy for this implementation. Notably, Naïve Bayes yields the highest accuracy percentage for determining the language for the given text. Nevertheless, any of the methods listed above can predict the language for any given text to a satisfactory expectation.
